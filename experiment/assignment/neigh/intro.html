<p>Neighbourhood operations are 
a generalization of the point operations. A pixel in the processed image 
now depends not only on the corresponding pixel in the input image but 
also its neighbouring pixels. This generalization also allows for defining 
linear as well nonlinear filtering operations. An example of linear 
filtering in image editing is to produce a soft focus effect by smoothing 
away the fine details. Image denoising is another application 
where neighbourhood operations are very useful. During transmission, 
an image may get corrupted with salt and pepper noise, where isolated 
pixels turn black or white and stand out from their background.
Performing a nonlinear filtering such as replacing a pixel by the median 
value of its neighbourhood values effectively removes the noise. </p>
<p>In this experiment, you will 
study the linear and non-linear operations. Specifically, you will study 
the effect of changing the size of the neighbourhood and the rule for 
combining the pixel values from the neighbourhood, on the result of 
processing.</p>
