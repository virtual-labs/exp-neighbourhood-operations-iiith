The experiment is designed to understand and learn the Neighborhood operations in images. This experiment consists of two experiments:

- **Linear filtering**  
- **Non-linear filtering**  

### Steps to run the experiments

1. Select an image from the mosaic using the 'select image' option.  
   - Select a region of the image to load it in the input image panel.  
2. Select one option from 'Linear filtering' or 'Non-linear filtering'.  
   - For linear filtering, select one option:  
     1. Straight average  
     2. Triangular average  
     3. Gaussian average  
   - For non-linear filtering, select one option:  
     1. Median filter  
     2. Unsharp filter  
3. Select one option from 'Neighborhood size'.  
4. Select the 'run' option to perform the operations.  
   - The output result will be displayed in the output panel.  

### Interesting Observations

1. Try any filtering option with different neighborhood sizes and compare the results.  
2. Try straight average and Gaussian average on the same image and neighborhood size, and compare the results.
